* [Prerequisites](docs/Prerequisites.md)


#### Initalize Terraform in Workspace Directory (local machine)
tutorial say to go to git repo directory and do 
```
$ terraform init
```

It doesn't work.
```
Terraform initialized in an empty directory!

The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working
with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.
```



--------------------------
## TODO

1. Everyone download Terraform (TF) to their local machines

3. Create shared [github repo](https://github.com/joshua-Evans-1/terraform-multi-cloud) for the project

1. Learn how to use TF to provision infrastructure for one cloud.

3. Create shared AWS account for project. Share credentials.

3. [Figure out how to provision it via terraform and launch a service on this cloud.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)Â 

4. Write out steps/ procedure in README file as we go. This will be part of our deliverable

6. Do step 3 for the other cloud - GCP or Azure

8. Figure out how to connect them and document the steps.
